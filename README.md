# bonfire-minimalist-player
A hilariously minimalist media player front-end for bonfire kitchen.

Contains no useful functions whatsoever, aside from a play-pause button that plays whatever happens to be in the queue (not shown). Nice for days when one feels like experiencing firsthand the flow and inevitability of life that really doesn't give one many options to choose from.
